    <blockquote>5 hidden and secret hotels-within-hotels, see below the names</blockquote>

    <p> <strong>Secret Hotel</strong> You just checked in at the front desk of your hotel and are making your way up the elevator to your room.
    Unbeknownst to you, there are people checking into their rooms in the very same building, but they're checking into an entirely different hotel.
    How can that be?
    It's part of the growing hotel-within-a-hotel trend that's popping up at select properties across North America.
    Aimed at a luxury-oriented, privacy-seeking clientele, these hotels-within-hotels are generally located on a specific floor or floors of an existing property and have their own entrance, their own staff and heightened services and amenities.
    These hidden properties don't typically display signage and are rarely advertised, so you could well be staying at the same location and not even know the other hotel exists.</p>

    <p>Personalized, refined
    The Flagler Club is a 25-room boutique hotel discretely located within The Breakers, the renowned Palm Beach, Florida, resort.
    It opened in late 2015 on the sixth and seventh floors of the property, following a $5 million renovation.
    "The hotel-within-a-hotel strategy is used to create something more upscale, with higher levels of service refinement," explains Tricia Taylor, senior vice president and general manager of The Breakers.
    "Hotels with thousands of guestrooms want to create an additional product offering within, that is smaller in scale to feel more intimate and personalized to guests," she says.
    Staying at a hotel-within-a-hotel is not to be confused with staying on the club or concierge level of an upscale property, although the concept is similar.
    "Concierge floors and club levels are found in chain hotels and primarily focus on inclusive food and drink," says Taylor. "Many hotels sell access passes to the concierge floor, or use it to reward loyal customers with upgrades.
    "In essence, the concierge floor becomes a VIP perk, and its guestrooms could be in a dedicated area or spread throughout a hotel; they are typically the same design as all of the hotel's guestrooms," she says.
    In contrast, the Flagler Club's rooms, service and amenities are different from those The Breakers' main hotel offers.
    "Nothing is replicated, not even the staff," says Taylor.
    So where are these elite hotels-within hotels?
    Here are a few properties worth reserving.
