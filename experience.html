  <h1>Erlich Bachman</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Erlich Bachman. I am a passionate lead of an incubator in the bustling tech start-up hub known as 'Silicon Valley' - also known as the tech capital of the entire world. I am personally responsible both as an investor and as the creative lead for several household names - the main one being, of course, Aviato. I have advanced skills in Javascript, Ruby, SQL, Python, and mostly all others. Aside from that, I was recently involved in the incubation and eventual funding of the incredibly revolutionary start up "Pied Piper" - it is without anyone's objection that I was the main reason that company is where it is today.
