    <h1>Buckminster Fuller</h1>

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    <p>
      There's so much to say about my life and experiences, but this is just an abbreviated version. To find out more, read my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_Chronofile" target="blank">Dymaxion Chronofile</a> <small>(AKA: my diary)</small>. In brief, I was expelled from Harvard <strong>twice</strong>: once for partying, and once for being disinterested. I'm very interested in the environment and sustainability. Did I mention that I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep#Buckminster_Fuller" target="blank">redesigned sleep?</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Some of my work</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4><strong>Dymaxion Car</strong>, <small>1933</small></h4>
        <p>This wasn't so much a car as the "ground taxiing phase" of a vehicle that might one day fly, land, and drive. Some idiot crashed into the prototype, but of course my vehicle was blamed. I think that's why it never became popular.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4><strong>Dymaxion Map</strong>, <small>1943</small></h4>
        <p>All map projections distort the actual size of continents somewhat, but my map is the most accurate flat representation of our round earth.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h4><strong>Geodesic Dome</strong>, <small>1945</small></h4>
        <p>The geodesic dome was created 20 years before I came along, but I popularized the idea and was awarded a patent for it. It's a strong and light structure.</p>

      </li>      
    </ul>

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Milton Academy</strong> — Graduated 1913</li>
      <li><strong>Harvard</strong> — Expelled 1914</li>
      <li><strong>Harvard</strong> — Expelled 1915</li>
    </ul>
