    Hello Internet. My name is Erlich Bachman and my interests are many. On this page, I would like to speak mainly of what makes me tick - how this brain works, and really what gets it going. Please defer to the right to see an example of my artistic side. While much of my time is centered around creating the best start-ups around, I also like to delve inside and create true peaces of art. 
  </p>

    Aside from that, I have a couple of people I would loosely called my friends. There is Richard - and while he is extremely sensitive, he also has become quite a good companion of mind. He has yet to admit that it was I that am responsible for the meteoric rise of Pied Piper, but we will get there.
